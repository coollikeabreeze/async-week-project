## **Project Overview**
Welcome to my Async Week Project for the Fullstack Academy Software Engineering Immersive! This project is a very simple application with the following features:
- PostgreSQL database of user data
- React / REST Application:
  - "Home" page with navigation to various components
  - "Users" component that displays user data
  - "Add User" component with a form to add a new user to the database
  - "User Analytics" component that displays Chart.js chart visualizations of user data
- Reactstrap styling (e.g. Form, Navbar, Breadcrumb, Card, Row, Col)


## **New Technology & Tool**

### [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
"Simple, clean and engaging HTML5 based JavaScript charts. Chart.js is an easy way to include animated, interactive graphs on your website for free."

### [Reactstap](https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/story/home-installation--page)
"Reactstrap is a React component library for Bootstrap. Reactstrap depends on the Bootstrap CSS framework for its styles and theme. This allows you to have consistent styles across your React-based components and static parts of your site, and allows you to include your own custom Bootstrap theme when needed."
